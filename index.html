       <h3>India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management</h3>
       <p><i>The Election Commission of India (ECI), established the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM) to advance its professional competence in election management, promote peoples participation, contribute to developing stronger democratic institutions and support the efforts of ECI in carrying out its mandate and functions.</i></p><br>
       <p><i>Over the last six decades, the structure and functions of the Election Commission have undergone major changes and thus the management of elections has become increasingly complex. A rapid transformation in social context and reality, rising number of political parties, changing dynamics and demands of coalitions and alliances, frequent elections and bye-elections, increase in number of eligible voters and continuous updating of electoral rolls have led to new challenges for election management bodies of today.</i></p>

        <p align="center"><i> In the United States, the right to vote is a fundamental aspect of democracy. Eligibility to vote is typically determined by state law, and generally includes U.S. citizens who are at least 18 years old . <br> However, there are some exceptions to these requirements, such as for individuals who have been convicted of a felony or who are currently in prison.</i></p>
        <p align="center"> <i>f you're interested in voting in an upcoming election, the first step is to make sure that you are registered to vote. This can typically be done online or in person at your local election office. You will usually need to provide some basic information, such as your name, address, and date of birth, as well as proof of citizenship.</i></p>
        <p align="center"><i>Once you are registered to vote, you can cast your ballot on Election Day, or in some cases, you may be able to vote early or absentee. Early voting allows you to cast your ballot in person before Election Day, while absentee voting allows you to vote by mail or drop-off. <br> Each state has its own rules and procedures for early and absentee voting, so it's important to check with your local election office for more information.</i></p>
        <p align="center"><i>When it comes time to vote, you will be asked to provide some form of identification. Again, the specific requirements for identification can vary from state to state, so it's important to check with your local election office to make sure that you have the necessary documents.</i></p>
